# Two-Stage-Four-Tiered-Hybrid-Intrusion-Detection-System-For-Internet-Of-Vehicles
 
**FOCUS**

Internet of Vehicles (IoV), an emerging subset of Internet of Everything (IoE) plays a 
critical role in the technological revolution. IoV, an extension of VANET turns every vehicle 
in the road into smart devices creating multi-communication model and enabling interaction 
between agent to agent (V2V), agent to public (V2H), agent to infrastructure(V2I), agent to 
roadside unit (V2R) and agent to sensors (V2S). The busy network with an enormous number 
of nodes connected to create a smarter intelligent transportation system with their powerful 
sense, store, process and secure networking capabilities are susceptible to cyber-attacks where 
the dynamic real time data is at stake. The vulnerabilities of such cyber-attack focus both within 
vehicular network and outside networks of present time vehicles. Many research papers have 
proposed models based on machine learning methodologies to detect the malicious 
interferences that damage the functioning of vehicular networks. The major concern of this 
project is to model a feasible and effective intrusion detection system (IDS) to highly secure 
the vehicular networks. This project proposes a multi-tiered hybrid intrusion detection system 
with standard pre-processing of data and feature engineering stages to mold the data for 
effective model learning and four main tiers adapting multiple machine learning algorithms 
that can efficiently detect different certain and uncertain cyber-attacks on intra-vehicle as well 
as external vehicular networks for modern vehicles. The four tiered hybrid intrusion detection 
system integrates a signature-based known IDS and an anomaly-based unknown IDS for 
detection with better accuracy. Experiment is carried out in public dataset namely CICIDS2017 
dataset. The proposed IDS model focuses on optimized, efficient and effective methods 
considering its implementation in real-time vehicles.
