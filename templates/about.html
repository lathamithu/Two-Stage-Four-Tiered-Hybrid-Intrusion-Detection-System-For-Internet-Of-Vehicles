        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet of Vehicles (IoV), an emerging subset of Internet of Everything (IoE) plays a critical role in the technological revolution. IoV, an extension of VANET turns every vehicle in the road into smart devices creating multi-communication model and enabling interaction between Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Public (V2H), Vehicle to Infrastructure(V2I), Vehicle to Roadside unit (V2R) and Vehicle to Sensors (V2S). The busy network with an enormous number of nodes connected to create a smarter intelligent transportation system with their powerful sense, store, process and secure networking capabilities are susceptible to cyber-attacks where the dynamic real time data is at stake. The vulnerabilities of such cyber-attack focus both intra-vehicle and external networks of present time vehicles. Many research papers have proposed models based on machine learning methodologies to detect the malicious interferences that damage the functioning of vehicular networks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major concern of this project is to model a feasible and effective intrusion detection system (IDS) to highly secure the vehicular networks. This project proposes a multi-tiered hybrid intrusion detection system with data preprocessing and feature engineering stages to mold the data for effective model learning and four main tiers adapting multiple machine learning algorithms that can efficiently detect different known and zero day cyber-attacks on intra-vehicle as well as external vehicular networks for modern vehicles. The four tiered hybrid intrusion detection system integrates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS for detection with better accuracy. Experiment is carried out in public dataset namely CICIDS2017 dataset. The proposed IDS model focuses on optimized, efficient and effective methods considering its implementation in real-time vehicles.
